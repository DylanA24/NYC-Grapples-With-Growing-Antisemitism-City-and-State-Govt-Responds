        <h1>NYC Grapples With Growing Antisemitism, City and State Govt Responds</h1>

        <p class="dek">Rise of antisemitism across the country felt in NYC.</p>

        <p>The word “Hamas” is <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/11/09/group-of-boys-spray-paints-swastikas-hamas-on-upper-east-side-buildings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sprayed</a> on an Upper East Side building. “Gas the jews” is <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/20/metro/vile-antisemitic-messages-praising-hitler-found-on-nyc-train/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scratched</a> onto Subway seats. A Jewish woman is <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/suspect-arrested-for-antisemitic-attack-on-woman-at-grand-central-subway-station-nypd/4800024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">punched</a> in the face at Grand Central Station because of her religion. These are just a few examples that suggest antisemitism is on the rise in New York City.</p>

        <p>NYC has the largest Jewish population in the country, according to <a href="https://ajpp.brandeis.edu/documents/2020/JewishPopulationDataBrief2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data</a> from the American Jewish Project. But this has not saved the city from the rise in hate crime, specifically antisemitism, seen around the country.</p>

        <p>Antisemitism makes up the largest percent of hate crime in NYC. The New York Police Department's updated <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Hate-Crimes/bqiq-cu78/about_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data</a> set shows that antisemetic hate crime makes up 58.45% of all hate crime in 2024 so far. This is an increase from 2023 where antisemitic hate crime made up 45.86% of the year’s hate crime total. Other hate crimes types remained stable.</p>

        <p>My analysis of the 2020 to 2023 NYPD data reveals a stark reality: antisemitic hate crimes in the city have escalated at an alarming rate, casting a shadow over the cultural diversity for which New York is known for. </p>

        <p>Vandalism has targeted synagogues; Jewish people have experienced physical and verbal abuse; and there is a disturbing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/nyregion/hate-crimes-rise-nyc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frequency</a> with which swastikas have defaced public areas.</p>
 
 <p>The rise in antisemitism can be attributed to the Israel-Hamas war that began in October. Manhattan is the most affected borough with 1,107 incidents within the 2019 to 2023 period, according to the NYPD data. On the other hand, Brooklyn, the most populated borough, has 935 incidents. The other boroughs have much lower counts: Queens with 494, The Bronx with 182 and Staten Island with 103 incidents.</p>

        <p>Gabriel Rigolosi, a Jewish high school senior who lives in NYC has witnessed the high tensions. He believes that the reason behind the increase in antisemitic hate crime is that people automatically associate Jewish people with Israel’s actions.</p>
<p>“I know before I'd be in the street going ‘Yeah, I’m Jewish bro’ and I have kind of stopped doing that,” he said. “My fear is that a lot of people are associating any type of Judaism with Israel. So if you're like, ‘yeah I'm Jewish,’ they automatically are like, ‘okay, you support Israel and you are the problem.’”</p>

        <p>Mayor Eric Adams held a rally with religious leaders at City Hall in December. He said that New Yorkers should not be living in fear. He stressed the importance of unity during this period of high global tension. </p>

        <p>"In this moment of high tension around the globe, it is more important than ever that we stand together as one, united against the rising tide of hatred and religious intolerance, we're seeing it and we're feeling it," said Adams.
</p>

        <p>All this tension has led Governor Kathy Hochul to expand state hate crime laws to cover graffiti and vandalism, which were previously not covered. The state law will also add 31 other offenses, including gang assault, sex trafficking and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>

<p>"Why should New Yorkers have to change their everyday lives because of fear of a hate crime?" Hochul said to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/gov-kathy-hochul-looks-to-expand-new-yorks-hate-crime-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>.

    <p>Grace Lee, a New York Assymblymember, agrees with Kathy Hochul’s bill and emphasizes how necessary it is to enact. </p>

   <p> "Every time a hate crime goes unrecognized, its victims are denied justice, and hate is further normalized and allowed to spread,” she said. “We understand that there is no single solution to eliminating hate; this is a complex issue that requires a diversified and holistic approach. This bill is one necessary step to help address hate and hold those who commit hate crimes accountable." </p>
